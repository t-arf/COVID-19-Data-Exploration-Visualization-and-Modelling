##DESCRIPTION:
In this notebook, we will use PyTorch to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a Chest X-Ray Radiography Dataset.
###Dataset: Dataset is from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

We have accomplished it in by completing each task in the project:
###TASKS: 
Importing Libraries
Creating Custom Dataset
Image Transformations
Prepare DataLoader
Data Visualization
Creating the Model
Training the Model
###Final Results: We get about 96.67% accuracy,
