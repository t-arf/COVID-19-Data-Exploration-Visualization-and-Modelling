## DESCRIPTION

In this notebook, we will use PyTorch to create and train a ResNet-18 model and apply it to a Chest X-Ray Radiography Dataset.
## Dataset: Dataset is from COVID-19 Radiography Dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)

We have accomplished it in by completing each task in the project:
### TASKS: 
#### 1. Importing Libraries
#### 2. Creating Custom Dataset
#### 3. Image Transformations
#### 4. Prepare DataLoader
#### 5. Data Visualization
#### 6. Creating the Model
#### 7. Training the Model
#### 8. Final Results: We get about 96.67% accuracy,
